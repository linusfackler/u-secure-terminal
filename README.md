### Login:
Enter one of the above account numbers and click "login".
It will then ask you to select a file. Since we couldn't buy an actual finger print scanner, the user will temporarily upload an image of a fingerprint.
There are pre-downloaded fingerprints in the downloaded folder.
After choosing an account ID and clicking login, navigate to your downloaded folder and select the corresponding fingerprint image.

### Create account:
Enter your name and click "create". It will then ask you to select an image. Since we couldn't buy an actual finger print scanner, the user will temporarily upload an image of a fingerprint.
There are pre-downloaded fingerprints in the downloaded folder.
Navigate to your downloaded folder and select any fingerprint that has "empty" in its name. This will be the accounts new fingerprint.

Once you logged in or created an account, you will see the main menu. In the top right you can see your account information.
If you created a new account, you should save your account number somewhere, since you won't have access to the database (just like on a real ATM).
You can try out any feature on the screen.
Every transaction will tbe logged on the transaction log.

The database is run fully remote on Microsoft Azure, which is why no local database installation is necessary.
